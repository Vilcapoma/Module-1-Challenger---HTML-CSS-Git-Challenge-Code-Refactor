HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor Due 12-22-2022

## Description
In the html file I ended up changing alot of the parent and child into their correct element.
Even on my CSS style folder I ended up making it much cleaner by combined some of the parents into one section and gave them all the same variable.
In this activity messing around with the CSS Style folder was very helpful to understand how much control the user has to make changes and learn from the mistakes.
